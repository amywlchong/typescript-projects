## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts.\

### `npm start`

Starts the Node.js server using the compiled version located at 'build/index.js'.

### `npm run dev`

Starts the server in development mode using ts-node-dev.\
This tool will automatically restart the server whenever TypeScript file changes are detected, making it easier to develop and test changes.

### `npm test`

Displays the message "Error: no test specified".\
Currently, there aren't any tests configured, so this script will simply echo an error message.

### `npm run tsc`

Compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.

### `npm run lint`

Identifies and reports on potential issues in TypeScript code, ensuring adherence to certain coding standards and style guidelines, thereby helping to maintain code quality.
