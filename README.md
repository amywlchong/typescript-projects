### Patientor is a medical record application for doctors to manage their patients' health and diagnosis data.

### [patientor-backend](https://github.com/amywlchong/typescript-projects/tree/master/patientor-backend)

Topics: Typing an Express app, interfaces, utility types, enums, validating requests (type checking, type guards, and type assertions), TypeScript best practices, etc.

The backend of Patientor comes equipped with various HTTP GET and POST endpoints for tasks like fetching patient details, adding new patients, and adding new medical entries. TypeScript features, such as interfaces, utility types, and enums, are utilized to structure and safeguard data. Type checks and data validation techniques are implemented to ensure data integrity. Moreover, robust error handling mechanisms are in place to handle different user inputs.

### [patientor-frontend](https://github.com/amywlchong/typescript-projects/tree/master/patientor-frontend)

Topics: Using TypeScript in React apps, typing components, props, and state, applying exhaustive type checking and switch-case based rendering, generics in TypeScript, TypeScript best practices, etc.

The frontend of Patientor offers a seamless experience, enabling users to view and add new patient information. Clicking on a patient's name brings up their full profile, which displays a rich breakdown of their medical history and associated diagnoses. Additionally, the app supports intuitive creation forms, allowing users to add new patients and new medical entries. Safeguards are in place to minimize data entry errors, providing users with feedback to minimize erroneous data inputs.
