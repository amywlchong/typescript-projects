## Services and Tools Needed

Npm: You'll need npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine for the development of this application. Npm is used to manage and install development tools and libraries.

Backend Server: The app uses Axios to make HTTP requests to a backend server. Make sure you have the backend server from [patientor-backend](https://github.com/amywlchong/typescript-projects/tree/master/patientor-backend) running. The server should be running on http://localhost:3001, as specified by the proxy setting in the package.json file. Ensure the backend server is correctly set up and running to fully interact with the frontend.
